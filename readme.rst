Register / Login with PHP SMS OTP

PHP - CodeIgniter
A package that sends an sms with a One-Time-Password to any phone number used by the user to login to their account.

It requires a TWILIO phone number that can be generated by registering at Twilio.

Currently it sends out sms to only those mobile numbers which are verified in the sandbox account.

To change this create an account on Twilio and create a twilio number to send out sms and call, then replace that number inside the the Signin.php controller.

INSTALLATION
